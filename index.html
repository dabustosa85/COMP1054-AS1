            <h2>Designed for use in various resolutions, sizes, and devices</h2>
            <p>Roboto is a sans-serif typeface geometric that is specially designed for use in various resolutions, sizes, and devices. Not only does Roboto CDN support Latin, Cyrillic scripts, and Greek, but it also comes with 12 varying weights. You can combine different fonts on your websites, such as Roboto slab, Roboto condensed, and the regular family.</p>
            <p class="super-class">Roboto CDN was released in the market in 2011. Christian Robertson, an in-house designer at Google, designed Roboto as a replacement for Droid, the Google font that was used for the Android system.</p>
            <p>Roboto was meant to have an excellent appearance on different screens. It is classified as a neo-grotesque typeface and features unique rounded racetrack-shaped letters and straight-sided capitals. Roboto CDN allows letters to accommodate enough space, which improves the reader’s experience.</p>
            <p>Some of the other grotesque Google fonts do not come with this feature. When it hit the market, Roboto was not an instant hit among small communities, with some Typography experts being quite skeptical about it. Some experts in the industry labeled it Frankenfont to mean that it had copied some elements from other typefaces, such as Myrida, Helvetica, Univers, and Ronnia.</p>
            <p>Roboto would later be updated in 2014 to tackle some of the objections. The update gave Roboto CDN a new design that made it independent. What we have today is the advanced yet accessible typeface. The remodeling provides a sneak peek of its future in readiness to adapt, seeing that the digital space evolves fast.</p>
